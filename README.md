Forecasting is everywhere. For years, people have been forecasting weather patterns, economic and political events, sports outcomes, and more. Because we try to predict so many different events, there are a wide variety of ways in which forecasts can be developed. Using simple intuition, expert opinions, or using of past results to compare with traditional statistical and time series techniques are just a few.

Forecasting accuracy is constantly being improved with the continual introduction of newer data science and machine learning techniques. In this post, we will look at machine learning techniques for forecasting and for time series data in particular.

Time Series Forecasting

Businesses use forecasting extensively to make predictions such as demand, capacity, budgets and revenue. One type of forecasting that routinely comes up in all of these scenarios is time series forecasting. Time series data is any data set that collects information regularly over a period of time. There are specific techniques for picking apart this type of data. Time series modelling has a range of modelling options which can work on different types of techniques. They include:

Linear vs. non-linear,
Parametric vs. non-parameteric,
And univariate vs. multivariate techniques.
